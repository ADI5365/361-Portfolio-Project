# Reviews Web App

### Overview
This web app is designed as a brand-neutral hub for honest product reviews. Here, there are no sellers paying consumers to post favorable reviews of their products, but instead people posting exactly what they think is fair for a purchased item.

### How To Use
On the home page are all reviews currently submitted to the app. There is a separate page that can be used to submit new reviews, which will then immediately appear among the other reviews. A user can also edit and delete their reviews at a later date if desired.
